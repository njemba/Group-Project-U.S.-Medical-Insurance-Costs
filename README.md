# Group-Project-U.S.-Medical-Insurance-Costs
# Project is part of the Codecademy Data Science path
# I made some changes to the requirements of the project: added some records to insurance.csv containing empty fields and/or 'inadequate values' (i.e. 'xxx' in age/bmi fields)
# I wanted to test how best to extract these inadequate data using the python instruments given so far.
